"""
Pipeline Structure:
Each cloud task follows the three-phase execution described in Section II.B
"If task vi is offloaded onto the cloud, there are three phases in sequence:
(i) the RF sending phase,
(ii) the cloud computing phase, and
(iii) the RF receiving phase."
"The local core in the mobile device or the wireless sending channel can only process or send one task at a time, and preemption is not allowed in this framework. On the other hand, the cloud can execute a large number of tasks in parallel as long as there is no dependency among the tasks."
Task Precedence (Section II.C):


For wireless sending (RTws_i): A task can start sending only after all its predecessors have completed their relevant phases
For cloud computation (RTc_i): A task can start computing after:

It has completed its sending phase
All its cloud-executed predecessors have finished computing


For wireless receiving (RTwr_i): A task can start receiving immediately after cloud computation finishes
